              Zeniak was a panda born different from any regular panda. He was
              highly intelligent and wanted more for other pandas who spent most
              of their time eating bamboo and resting all day
              <br />
              In his search for this source of intelligence,he came across an
              ancient scroll containing the secret location of ‚Äòthe source of
              intelligence‚Äô Zeniak set out on a mission with his pack to this
              secret location.

              After traveling for months and spending sleepless nights trying to
              transcribe the scroll, luck favored Zeniak and he found the source
              of intelligence to be a fountain of water right in the middle of a
              volcano. <br/> Only one crazy enough would deem it fit to continue but
              he did, he sought out this great power. Zeniak going through fire
              and brimstone, survived the feat with a vial of the fountain of
              intelligence and gave it to his pack, every panda with a little
              drop to taste.
